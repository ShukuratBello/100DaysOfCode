#### 01-09-2023 ~ I Commit to show up everyday for #100days of Code

I am learning python all over again and today I learned:

- A: List, Tuples, Sets and their method in Python. I went over Strings, string methods, integers and floats as well.
- B: I did an easy python chaalenge that takes input and returns the input back to the user in sentence format.
