# Day 1 - 01/09/2023 ~ I Commit to show up everyday for #100days of Code

I am learning python all over again and today I learned:
I learnt about List Tuple and Sets from Corey's Video - Day 4, you can find the [code here](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\4-Lists_Tuples_and_Sets.py). I also did reddit challenge and you can find it [here](Day01\Day01.md)

- A: List, Tuples, Sets and their method in Python. I went over Strings, string methods, integers and floats as well.
- B: I did an easy python chaalenge that takes input and returns the input back to the user in sentence format.

# Day 2 - 02/09/2023
I learnt Dictionaries and working with key value pairs from Corey's videos - Day 5, you can find the [code here](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\5-Dictionaries_Working_with_Key_Value_Pairs.py). 
and exercise 1 from the book. My code attempt is [here](Day02\exercise1_Number_guessing_game.py)

- A: Dictionary in Python. How to loop over dictionary key value pairs.
- B: I did exercise 1/50 of the python book. I wrote a simple guessing game. I practise while loops and if statements.

# Day 3 - 03/09/2023
I learnt about conditional statements and booleans in Python. I also learned how to write if, elif and else statements. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\6-Conditionals_and_Booleans_If_Else_and_Elif_Statement.py)

# Day 4 - 04/09/2023
I had a slow tired day today so I only learnt For loops and While loops with Corey's Youtube Videos. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\7-Loops_and_Iterations_For_While_Loops.py)

# Day 5 - 05/09/2023
I learnt how to write functions with python and tried my hands at some examples. I've always struggled with functions in the past and will need to practice more to better understand it. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\7-Loops_and_Iterations_For_While_Loops.py)

# Day 6 - 06/09/2023
I learned how to write functions in Python. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\8-Functions.py)

* simple functions
* functions with arguement
* functions with positional arguement and keyword arguement

# Day 7 - 07/09/2023
I wrote a sum() function using python, it was exercise 2 from the book. Skipped the videos today. I think that thinking about the solution to a coding challenge is very hard. My code attempt is [here](Day06_07\Exercise2_summing_numbers.py)
* I wrote a function sum()
* I used Pythons "splat" operator * (*nums) to allow a function to receive any number of (unknown) arguments.


# Day 8 - 08/09/2023
I learned about package management system 'pip' and how to use it. Because it is done via the command line, I practiced it with my laptop terminal. Here is the [note] (CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\13-pip_package_management_system.py)

 > How to install packages with pip.
 > List installed packages.
 > Upgrade and also delete packages.
 > How to freeze packages and save them into a file

# Day 9 - 09/09/2023

# Day 10 - 10/09/2023
I learned how to create virtual Environments and use different environments to manage different projects
#### 10-09-2023 ~ Using Corey's video, I learned how to create a virtual environment to manage multiple pyhton projects.

 > How to create a virtual environment
 > How to install packages with pip in virual environment
 > Most of the commands didn't work, I guess because corey uses MAC and I had to look for their python equivalent.
