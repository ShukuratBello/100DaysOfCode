# Day 1 - 01/09/2023
I learnt about List Tuple and Sets from Corey's Video - Day 4, you can find the [code here](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\4-Lists_Tuples_and_Sets.py). I also did reddit challenge and you can find it [here](Day01\Day01.md)

# Day 2 - 02/09/2023
I learnt Dictionaries and working with key value pairs from Corey's videos - Day 5, you can find the [code here](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\5-Dictionaries_Working_with_Key_Value_Pairs.py). 
and exercise 1 from the book. My code attempt is [here](Day02\exercise1_Number_guessing_game.py)

# Day 3 - 03/09/2023
I learnt about conditional statements and booleans in Python. I also learned how to write if, elif and else statements. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\6-Conditionals_and_Booleans_If_Else_and_Elif_Statement.py)

# Day 4 - 04/09/2023
I had a slow tired day today so I only learnt For loops and While loops with Corey's Youtube Videos. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\7-Loops_and_Iterations_For_While_Loops.py)


# Day 5 - 05/09/2023
I learnt how to write functions with python and tried my hands at some examples. I've always struggled with functions in the past and will need to practice more to better understand it. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\7-Loops_and_Iterations_For_While_Loops.py)


# Day 6 - 06/09/2023
I learned how to write functions in Python. Here is the [code](CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\8-Functions.py)


# Day 7 - 07/09/2023
I wrote a sum() function using python, it was exercise 2 from the book. Skipped the videos today. I think that thinking about the solution to a coding challenge is very hard. My code attempt is [here](Day06_07\Exercise2_summing_numbers.py)

# Day 8 - 08/09/2023
I learned about package management system 'pip' and how to use it. Because it is done via the command line, I practiced it with my laptop terminal. Here is the [note] (CoreySchafer_Python_Youtube\13-pip_package_management_system.py)

# Day 9 - 09/09/2023
