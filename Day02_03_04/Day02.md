#### 02-09-2023 ~ I Commit to show up everyday for #100days of Code

I am learning python all over again and today I learned:

- A: Dictionary in Python. How to loop over dictionary key value pairs.
- B: I did exercise 1/50 of the python book. I wrote a simple guessing game. I practise while loops and if statements.
